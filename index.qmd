## Postdoctoral Researcher, Amazon

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher on the SCOT Topline Science Team at Amazon in New York, where I develop macroeconomic forecasting models and conduct causal analysis using state space models.

I received my PhD in Economics from Harvard University in 2024, specializing in Macroeconomics and Econometrics. My research focuses on macroeconomic forecasting, causal inference, and time series analysis.

### Current Work

At Amazon, I work on:

- Development of state space forecasting models for supply chain optimization
- Causal macroeconomic analysis and policy evaluation

- AI-assisted research workflows using LLM APIs
